<h2>BUDGET OVERVIEW AND PROCESS</h2>

The Office of the Director of Finance
The Office of the Director of Finance is the chief financial and budget officer of the City and is responsible for the financial functions of the City including development of the annual operating budget, the capital budget, and capital program; the City’s program for temporary and long-term borrowing; supervision of the operating budget’s execution; the collection of revenues through the Department of Revenue; and the oversight of pension administration as Chairperson of the Board of Pensions and Retirement. The Office of Budget and Program Evaluation (OBPE) within the Office of the Director of Finance oversees the preparation of the operating and capital budgets. Once the operating and capital budgets are adopted, OBPE is responsible for monitoring operating spend by class code and department and capital budgets, including projects, budget lines, funding, historical records of bid awards, cost over runs, as well as other fiscal and project information.

<h3>Operating Budget</h3>

Submitted on an annual basis, the operating budget is comprised of a consolidated budget of all the operating obligations and expected revenues of the City. The Home Rule Charter requires the Operating budget to be adopted by City Council at least thirty days before the end of the fiscal year. The City’s fiscal year begins July 1 and ends on June 30th of the following calendar year.

The operating funds of the City, consisting of the General Fund, nine Special Revenue Funds (County Liquid Fuels Tax, Special Gasoline Tax, Health Choices Behavioral Health, Hotel Room Rental Tax, Grants Revenue, Community Development, Car Rental Tax, Acute Care Hospital Assessment and Housing Trust Funds) and two Enterprise Funds (Water and Aviation), are subject to annual operating budgets adopted by City Council. Included with the Water Fund is the Water Residual Fund. These budgets appropriate funds for all City departments, boards and commissions by major class of expenditure within each department. Major classes are defined as: personal services; purchase of services; materials and supplies; equipment; contributions, indemnities and taxes; debt service; payments to other funds; and advances and other miscellaneous payments. Expenditures for the repair of any property, the repaving or repairing of streets, and the acquisition of any property, or for any work or project which does not have a probable useful life to the City of at least five years are deemed to be ordinary expenses provided for in the annual operating budget ordinance. Appropriations for the use of any departmental board or commission are made to the department with which it is connected.

The appropriation amounts for each fund are supported by revenue estimates and take into account the elimination of accumulated deficits and the re-appropriation of accumulated surpluses to the extent necessary. All transfers between major classes (except for materials and supplies and equipment, which are appropriated together) must have City Council approval. Appropriations that are not expended or encumbered at year-end are lapsed.


The annual review process for the operating budget has several stages. The process begins with the Budget Call, where departments are required to submit their budget requests, including the following information: previous fiscal year actual expenditures, current estimates, the proposed current budget, the five year plan estimates and information on personnel projections. The information is also sorted by major class and fund which is the legal requirement. Departments submit their budget requests which are compiled and used by OBPE to discuss departmental requests and make budgetary recommendations.

At least 90 days before the end of the Fiscal Year the operating budget for the next Fiscal Year is prepared by the Mayor and must be submitted to City Council for adoption. Once the budget review process is over, OBPE assembles the proposed budget which is known as the Mayor’s Operating Budget in Brief. Once the budget ordinance is introduced in City Council, the Operating Budget Detail is prepared and distributed in time for the annual operating budget City Council hearing process.

<h3>Capital Program and Capital Budget</h3>

The capital program serves as a blueprint for capital expenditures and makes possible long range planning for capital improvements in the City’s physical and technology infrastructure, community facilities, and public buildings. The capital program is prepared annually by the City Planning Commission and OBPE to present the capital expenditures planned for each of the six ensuing fiscal years, including the estimated total cost of each project and the sources of funding (local, state, Federal, and private) estimated to be required to finance each project. The capital budget must conform with the applicable capital program so that long range planning will not be upset.

The annual review process for capital spending requests and recommendations has several stages. All departments requesting capital funding must submit a formal annual request to the City Planning Commission. In addition to their annual capital requests, the agencies are required to present their capital needs over a six year period. After the submission period is over, the City Planning Commission and OBPE schedule meetings with each agency, analyze the capital requests, and recommend projects for the Six Year Capital Program. The capital program is reviewed by the Mayor and transmitted to City Council for adoption.

<h3>Council Approval and Adoption</h3>

The Charter requires that at least 30 days before the end of each fiscal year, City Council must adopt by ordinance an operating budget and a capital budget for the ensuing fiscal year and a capital program for the next six years. If the Mayor disapproves the bill, he or she must return it to City Council with the reasons for his or her disapproval at the first meeting thereof held not more than ten days after receiving it. If the Mayor does not return the ordinance within the time required, it becomes law without his or her approval. If City Council passes the bill by a vote of two-thirds of all of its members within seven days after the bill has been returned with the Mayor’s disapproval, it becomes law without the Mayor’s approval.


The City’s capital budget is appropriated by project for each department. Requests to transfer appropriations between projects must be approved by City Council. Any appropriations that are not obligated at year-end are either lapsed or carried forward to the next fiscal year. The capital budget ordinance, authorizing in detail the capital expenditures to be made or incurred in the ensuing fiscal year from City Council appropriated funds, is adopted by City Council concurrently with the capital program. The capital budget must be in full conformity with that part of the capital program applicable to the fiscal year that it covers.


<h2>Basis of Budgeting</h2>

<h3>BASIS OF BUDGETING AND FINANCIAL POLICIES</h3>

Each Financial Plan reflects balanced budgets for each fiscal year of the City. All revenue and appropriation estimates are on a modified accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted standards.

Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available. The City considers tax revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Expenditures are generally recorded when a liability is incurred, as in the case of full accrual accounting. Debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due; however, those expenditures may be accrued if they are to be liquidated with available resources.
The City, through the Office of Budget and Program Evaluation (OBPE) estimates general fund revenues. The OBPE provides forecasts of the six major taxes, as well as the estimates for the other categories. OBPE employs a number of approaches to developing its forecasts of local revenues:
Forecasts of economic activity provided by several sources including the Congressional Budget Office and the Blue Chip Economic Indicators;
Continuous evaluation of national and local economic data on employment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth;
Ongoing examination of the City’s current tax receipts;
Economic forecasting of tax revenues provided by a revenue forecasting consultant;
Discussions with economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia; and
The extensive experience of its staff within the Office of the Director of Finance and OBPE.

OBPE’s tax projections for the Five Year Plan are developed in conjunction with a revenue forecasting consultant, which created econometric models that include variables such as wage and salary disbursements in the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and the county, personal income in the county, the unemployment rate, house prices in the county, real estate transaction growth, and national corporate profits. These models, together with their forecast of the Philadelphia economy, are used by the consultant to project tax revenues for the City with a focus on six taxes – Wage and Earnings Tax, Business Income and Receipts Tax, Real Estate Tax, Real Estate Transfer Tax, Sales Tax and Net Profits Tax. These projections are refined by OBPE after discussions with economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.


Estimates of revenues to be received from the Commonwealth are based on historical patterns, currently available levels, or on levels proposed in a budget by the Governor. Estimates of revenues to be received from the Federal Government are based on historical patterns, currently available levels, or on levels proposed in a budget by the President of the United States or in a Congressional budget resolution. Nontax revenues are based on current or proposed rates, charges or fees, historical patterns and generally recognized econometric models. Appropriation estimates include, at a minimum, all
obligations incurred during the fiscal year and estimated to be payable during the fiscal year or in the 24 month period following the close of the current fiscal year, and all obligations of prior fiscal years not covered by encumbered funds from prior fiscal years.

All cash flow projections provide for operations of the City to be conducted within the resources projected and are based upon assumptions as to sources and uses of cash. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, assumptions as to the timing of receipt and expenditure of cash and the issuance of tax or revenue anticipation notes of the City. All estimates take into account the past and anticipated collection, expenditure and service demand experience of the City and current and projected economic conditions.


Budget schedules prepared on the legally enacted basis differ from the General Accepted Accounting Principles basis in that both expenditures and encumbrances are applied against the current budget, adjustments affecting activity budgeted in prior years are accounted for through fund balance or as reduction of expenditures and certain inter-fund transfers and reimbursements are budgeted as revenues and expenditures. A difference between the City’s fund balance on a GAAP and budgetary, or legally enacted, basis can arise when, for example, taxes are collected midyear (e.g. April 2014) for the current calendar year. While legally these revenues are collected for and accounted for during that fiscal year (FY15), on a GAAP basis only half of the revenue can be accounted for in that fiscal year (FY15). The other half of the tax revenue would need to be accounted for in the next fiscal year (FY16). Thus differences can arise between fund balance estimates on a GAAP basis versus a budgetary basis as a result of the timing of receipts.

<h3>Financial Policies</h3>

Relationship and Reporting to PICA: The Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority was created on June 5, 1991 by the PICA Act for Cities of the First Class (the “PICA Act”). PICA was established to provide financial assistance to cities of the first class. The City is the only city of the first class in the Commonwealth. Each of the Governor of Pennsylvania, the President pro tempore of the Pennsylvania Senate, the Minority Leader of the Pennsylvania Senate, the Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and the Minority Leader of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives appoints one voting member of PICA’s board. The Secretary of the Budget of the Commonwealth and the Director of Finance of the City serve as ex officio members of PICA’s board with no voting rights.

The PICA Act provides that, upon request by the City to PICA for financial assistance and for so long as any bonds issued by PICA remain outstanding, PICA shall have certain financial and oversight functions. The PICA Act requires the City to annually develop a five-year financial plan and obtain PICA’s approval of it. PICA has the power, in its oversight capacity, to exercise certain advisory and review procedures with respect to the City’s financial affairs, including the power to review and approve five-year financial plans prepared at least annually by the City, and to certify non-compliance by the City with the then- existing five-year plan adopted by the City pursuant to the PICA Act.


PICA is also required to certify non-compliance if, among other things, no approved five-year plan is in place or the City has failed to file mandatory revisions to an approved five-year plan. The PICA Act requires the City to prepare and submit quarterly reports to PICA so that PICA may determine whether the City is in compliance with the then-current Five-Year Plan. Under the PICA Act, a “variance” is deemed to have occurred as of the end of a reporting period if (i) a net adverse change in the fund balance of a covered fund of more than 1% of the revenues budgeted for such fund for that fiscal year is reasonably projected to occur, or (ii) the actual net cash flows of the City for a covered fund are reasonably projected to be less than 95% of the net cash flows of the City for such covered fund for that fiscal year originally forecasted at the time of adoption of the budget. The Mayor is required to provide a report to PICA that describes actual or current estimates of revenues, expenditures, and cash flows by covered funds compared to budgeted revenues, expenditures, and cash flows by covered funds for each month in the previous quarter and for the year-to-date period from the beginning of the then-current fiscal year of the City to the last day of the fiscal quarter or month, as the case may be, just ended. Each such report is required to explain any variance existing as of such last day.

PICA may not take any action with respect to the City for variances if the City (i) provides a written explanation of the variance that PICA deems reasonable; (ii) proposes remedial action that PICA believes will restore overall compliance with the then-current Five-Year Plan; (iii) provides information in the immediately succeeding quarterly financial report demonstrating to the reasonable satisfaction of PICA that the City is taking remedial action and otherwise complying with the then-current Five-Year Plan; and (iv) submits monthly supplemental reports as required by the PICA Act.

Under the PICA Act, any such certification of non-compliance would require the Secretary of the Budget of the Commonwealth to withhold payments due to the City from the Commonwealth or any of its agencies (including, with certain exceptions, all grants, loans, entitlements and payment of the portion of the PICA Tax, hereinafter described, otherwise payable to the City).
